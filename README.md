Javascript Projects - meteor, react, Angular2, Node.js 

1. (App 1 - Meteor + React) Creating a To-Do list application with collaboration of multiple people on the tasks. 
Important concepts:
- Hot Code Push - Updating any file or making changes to the database, displays the changes on the browser page in real time! No need to reload the page. 

Install Meteor (OSX/ Linux): curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

- Steps to run the project: 
  - meteor create todo-list (you don't need to do this once you download the project folder - the application folder has all  the required files). 
  - cd todo-list (start with this step, provided you have the folder in your default directory, else give the full path) 
  - meteor npm install
  - meteor 

The application would be running at http://localhost:3000/
- If you open multiple browsers with this URL and update the list, you will notice that the list gets updated across all browsers.
